This repo consists of a movie ticket booking system for a single theatre made using oracle as backend and python tkinter as frontend. I have also attached another code for this without the help of sql and this makes use of python design patterns.

meow.sql - this contains the oracle sql code for the booking system 
meow.py - this contains the python code ,that is connected to oracle


movies_pdp - this is a movie_ticket booking system built using python design patterns and csv files.

this is how the frontend will look when you use meow.sql and meow.py:
