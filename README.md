This repo consists of a movie ticket booking system for a single theatre made using oracle as backend and python tkinter as frontend. I have also attached another code for this without the help of sql and this makes use of python design patterns.
## ATTENTION: This repo contains two different ways of doing the same project- Oracle and design patterns   

# software requirements 
python - https://www.python.org/downloads/  
oracle - sqlplus (or any other compatible oracle server)

# necessary command line prompts 

pip install cx_Oracle  
pip install PIL (or pip install pillow)

# Project using oracle 

meow.sql - this contains the oracle sql code for the booking system   
meow.py - this contains the python code ,that is connected to oracle  
(use these files together)


# oracle output
this is how the frontend will look when you use meow.sql and meow.py:

I will attach the pdf for how the pdp project will look like:
